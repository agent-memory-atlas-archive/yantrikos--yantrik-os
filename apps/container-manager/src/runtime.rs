//! What it was written to fix: every mutation in this app ran
//! `let _ = Command::new(runtime_cmd())...output();`, so a `docker rm` the daemon refused was
//! indistinguishable from one it performed, and the control surface answered `{"removed": name}`
//! either way. And `docker ps` failing produced the same empty list as `docker ps` succeeding
//! with nothing to show, so a mind reading this app on a machine without docker concluded the
//! machine was simply empty.
