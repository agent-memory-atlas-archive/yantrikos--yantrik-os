"""The Yantrik control surface, inside Blender.

Blender is not ours. It is a program this OS opens, like the browser. What makes it an app
of this desktop rather than a window a mind can only photograph is this addon: it binds
`app-blender.sock` in the session's socket directory and answers `app.describe` and
`app.act` in the same JSON-RPC every other app speaks, so `yos describe blender` reads a
scene the way `yos describe notes` reads a note — and the same ceiling, the same revision
guard and the same refusal vocabulary bind it, because `surface.py` is a port of
`yantrik-app-runtime::control`'s dispatch rather than an opinion of its own.

Threading. The socket is served on a thread of its own; `bpy` is not thread-safe and every
read or change of the scene is marshalled onto Blender's main thread and waited for — the
same hop the Rust apps make with `slint::invoke_from_event_loop`. How the main thread picks
the work up differs by mode, because the two modes have different main threads:

  * windowed: a `bpy.app.timers` callback pumps the queue, so the hop lands between
    Blender's own event-loop turns;
  * background (`blender -b`): there is no event loop to time, so `start()` becomes the
    main loop and pumps the queue itself until the process is stopped.

Tests. Nothing below this file imports `bpy` at import time — `scene.py` is handed the
module — so `tests/blender-core` drives the whole dispatch layer against a fake. This file
is the only place that touches the real thing.

    """Keep Blender's splash off the window this surface is about to drive. Returns True
    when the preference was turned off, False when there was nothing to do.

    Opened from the launcher, a stock Blender puts its splash over the viewport; on a
    machine whose desktop user has never saved preferences (no `userpref.blend` — every
    fresh Yantrik install) that splash is the first-run Quick Setup, and none of the
    surface's actions can dismiss it, so the OS goes on editing the scene behind a dialog
    the person has not answered (#119). Blender 4.3 checks `show_splash` first of all
    (`USER_SPLASH_DISABLE` in `wm_init_splash_show_on_startup_check`), and runs `--python`
    scripts before that check (`ARG_PASS_FINAL` precedes `WM_init_splash_on_startup` in
    creator.cc), so turning the preference off here is early enough and is the whole fix.

    Nothing is written to disk by this function. Blender marks the preference dirty and,
    with `use_preferences_save` on (its default), writes `userpref.blend` on a clean quit —
    which is also what marks first-run done for the person's own later starts. That is
    Blender's own behaviour for any preference change; the addon does not save preferences
    itself, because overwriting a person's preference file is not a thing a socket should
    decide.

    Background Blender has no window, so there is no splash and nothing to touch.
