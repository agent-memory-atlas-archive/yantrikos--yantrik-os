//! The download engine — what the buttons in this window actually do.
//!
//! Until now this app was a window with no machinery behind it: every callback logged a line and
//! returned, so the list was always empty and nothing ever reached disk. That is why it had no
//! control surface. `docs/app-control.md` is explicit that an app whose data is a stub should not
//! publish one, because a confident lie in JSON is worse than a screenshot a model has to guess
//! at. So the engine comes first and the surface follows it.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! One [`Engine`] holds every download and is cheap to clone — it is a handle onto shared state,
//! not the state itself. Each transfer runs on its own thread, writing to the file and to the
//! shared record as it goes; the UI thread never blocks on the network and never touches a
//! socket. Threads talk to the window only by bumping [`Engine::revision`], which the window
//! polls: a worker that tried to push into Slint would need a weak handle and an
//! `invoke_from_event_loop` per chunk, and would repaint the list sixty times a second for a fast
//! transfer. Polling a revision costs one atomic load per tick and repaints only on real change.
//!
//! # Stopping
//!
//! Pause, cancel and "the window is closing" are the same question — *should this thread still be
//! writing?* — so they share one [`Control`] flag per download, checked once per chunk. A paused
//! download keeps its partial file and its byte count, which is the entire reason resume can be
//! more than a restart.
//!
//! # Resume is a request, not a guarantee
//!
//! Resuming sends `Range: bytes=N-` and hopes. A server that honours it answers `206` and the
//! remaining bytes get appended. A server that does not answers `200` and the body it sends is the
//! *whole file* — appending that to a partial one produces a corrupt file that still looks
//! complete. So a `200` to a ranged request truncates and starts over, and `resume_supported`
//! records which answer came back so the window can stop promising something this server will not
//! do.
//!
//! # Keeping the list
//!
//! Until now the list lived only in this process, so closing the window lost every record and left
//! every partial transfer on disk as a file nobody could explain or continue. A mind that started a
//! 4 GB image and came back after a restart found nothing. The list is now written to
//! `~/.local/share/yantrik/downloads/state.json` on every transition worth noticing, and read back
//! at start.
//!
//! The file is a record of intent, not a measurement, and it is never trusted as one. On the way
//! back in every record is reconciled against what is actually on the filesystem: the byte count
//! comes from the partial file itself, a download that was still running when the process died
//! comes back **paused and interrupted** rather than silently restarted, and a completed file that
//! is no longer where it was recorded comes back as [`Status::Missing`] rather than as a success
//! the person cannot open. Nothing on disk is deleted by reconciliation — a stray partial file
//! whose record is gone is left exactly where it is, because it is the person's data and a
//! forgotten record is not permission to remove it.
