//! The three places a picture can come from, behind one trait.
//!
//! They are deliberately not equal. ComfyUI is the "your own GPU" route and speaks a graph; the
//! OpenAI-compatible route speaks a sentence and bills for it; the fake route draws a placeholder
//! and is what an unconfigured machine gets rather than an app that refuses to open. What they
//! share is one question — make this picture — and one answer, bytes plus the facts that go into
//! the sidecar beside the file.
//!
//! Nothing in here touches Slint or the filesystem. Every backend runs on a worker thread and is
//! tested against a fake rather than a service somebody has to be running.
