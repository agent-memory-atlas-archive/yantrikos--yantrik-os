//! The state Studio holds: which backend is configured, what is being made, and what has been made.
//!
//! Generation runs on worker threads, because a render takes seconds to minutes and the control
//! surface has a three-second budget on the thread that owns the window. The actions therefore
//! declare that they settle later, and the queue in `describe` is how a caller watches one.
//!
//! The gallery is a cache of files on disk. That is deliberate: the files are the real thing, and
//! a cache can be wrong in a way that a second copy of the truth cannot. Anything that changes the
//! folder — including a person copying a picture into it — is picked up by `poll`, and `refresh`
//! reads it again on demand.
