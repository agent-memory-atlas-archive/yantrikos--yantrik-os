//! A window's pane: everything about one Notes window that belongs to the view and not to the note
//! (design/notes-gate-2026-10-21.md §2, "Views and windows"). A note shown in two windows is one
//! document with two views: its text, unsaved state, conflict and draft are the document's, and
//! each window keeps its own pane, with its undo history, search, dialog, scroll and footer line.
//!
//! The focused window's pane is `Model::pane`, and every command acts there: a command from a
//! window focuses that window first, and a job's landing, or a close, is applied in the window it
//! is about, with the focus put back afterwards (update/windows.rs). The other windows' panes wait
//! in `Model::parked`. So the code that acts on "the open note" has one pane to act on, and it is
//! always the right one.
//!
//! The focus moves for a moment wherever work is done in another window ([`Model::within`]); the
//! person moves only by acting in a window or opening one ([`Model::enter`]). `Model::visited`
//! keeps the windows in the order the person was last in them, so when the focused window closes,
//! the focus goes back to the window the person was in before it.
