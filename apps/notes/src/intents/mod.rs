//! What a mind may ask Notes by name: the twenty-one actions worded, argued and graded as they
//! always were, the three choices about an outside change (step 8d) and the two about unsaved
//! text kept from before Notes closed (8d-3), each the command its window action runs.
//!
//! A description is written at the definition site of every action, and [`act`] and [`arg`]
//! refuse to build one that is a placeholder: every description used to be `"Notes: {name}"`
//! and every argument optional, which is why a model asked for a note titled Groceries made a
//! note with no title. `yos describe` prints each description and each argument's type, required
//! flag and description, so what is written here is verbatim what a model reads.
//!
//! Every call is answered once its work has landed (`Settle::Explicit`): "it worked" is what the
//! disk says afterwards, never the handler's opinion of itself.
//!
//! The actions are written by family, one file each. The order a mind reads them in is the one
//! Notes has always published (tests/parity.rs pins it), so each family is a run of that order and
//! [`table`] adds them one after another.
