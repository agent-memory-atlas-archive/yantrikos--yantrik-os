//! Gate row "Save failure" (design/notes-gate-2026-10-21.md §3), on Notes with a real vault: every
//! way a save can fail, through the framework's fault-injecting disk. Each failure keeps the edits
//! as edits, says in the notice how much reached the disk, reports it in `describe.save_failure`,
//! is not retried by the autosave, and is retried by the person's Save, and once another note's save
//! lands (#918's review, 2).
