"""The sandbox an agent's LibreOffice runs in: bubblewrap namespaces, with Landlock inside (#953).

A formula, a link, a macro, a filter or an export reads and connects with the rights of the
process that evaluates it. Five rounds of review found ways round a scan of formulas, and then
round a Landlock fence alone: Landlock cannot refuse `connect()` to a UNIX socket by path, so the
person's own LibreOffice pipe and the session bus stayed reachable (#942, M1). So the LibreOffice
that does an agent's work now starts in a world of its own, built by `bwrap`:

  * its own mount namespace, on an empty root: only what is bound below exists in it. That is
    /usr and a short list of /etc read-only, the few places LibreOffice's own links point to
    (Debian's /var/spool/libreoffice, #942 M2), a fresh /proc for its own processes, a minimal
    /dev with a private /dev/shm, and four private folders of the adapter's: its profile, its
    temporary files, the copies of the documents it works on, and a /tmp holding nothing but its
    own UNO pipe. The person's home, /run (the session bus, the display, every Yantrik socket)
    and the real /tmp are not there to name;
  * its own network namespace: no interface but loopback, so no TCP, no UDP, and no abstract
    UNIX socket of the session's (those belong to a network namespace);
  * its own IPC, PID and UTS namespaces, a new session (no terminal to push keys into), no
    capabilities, and it dies with the adapter;
  * an environment of its own: no DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, DISPLAY or
    WAYLAND_DISPLAY.

Inside it, fence.py puts Landlock up as a second wall where the kernel offers it, then proves the
sandbox holds before LibreOffice starts: the person's protected places and the home cannot be
opened, the person's sockets and three canaries the adapter left listening outside cannot be
reached, and no network leaves. Only then is soffice run. Where bwrap is missing or cannot make
the namespaces, nothing is started and the agent's call is refused.

This module only builds the command: it starts nothing but the availability check.
