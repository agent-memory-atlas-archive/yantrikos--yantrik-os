"""Which formulas an agent may write into a cell (#942's review).

A Calc formula can read a file or a URL with the person's rights: an external reference like
`='file:///…'#$Sheet1.A1`, `INDIRECT`, `DDE`, `WEBSERVICE`, `HYPERLINK`, and `read_cells` hands
the result back. So an agent's formula is held to an allowlist: every function it calls must be
one that only reads cells of the same document, and it may name no other document. Anything
else is refused with a sentence. The person's own formulas are not held to this.
