"""LibreOffice's surface: what a mind reads, what it may ask for, and what each action costs.

Built only on the public Python SDK (`yantrik_surface`): the dispatch, the argument checks, the
revision guard, the ceiling, the mode and the grant are all the SDK's, and this file is only
LibreOffice's vocabulary. The work itself is `office.Office`, over UNO.

The grades, and why (README.md has the long form):

  read_text, read_cells        safe       reading changes nothing
  open, close                  standard   a window opens or shuts; no file changes; `close`
                                          refuses a document with unsaved changes
  write_text, write_cells      standard   the document in memory changes, and nothing on disk
                                          does until `save`; LibreOffice's Undo takes it back
  save_as, export_pdf          standard   they only ever create a new file: a path that exists
                                          is refused, which is what keeps them `standard`
  save                         sensitive  it replaces the file the document came from; with
                                          writes `standard`, this is the one step at which a
                                          person decides whether a mind's edits become the file

None of the descriptions says the action cannot be undone, and that is a decision too: the
words would make `auto` mode ask about `save` as well, and a person who chose `auto` has said
that `sensitive` work may run unasked.
