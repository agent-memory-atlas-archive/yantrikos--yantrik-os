//! The Mind, as an app reaches it (design/app-framework-2026-10-21.md, §5).
//!
//! The model, the memory and the bond live in the shell process; an app talks to them over the
//! socket bus like any service. This crate is that conversation, typed: [`ask`] runs from a job
//! only (it may take a minute on a cold model), [`recall_relevant`] filters the memory to what
//! is worth a person's eye, [`reach`] says without waiting whether the shell can answer at all,
//! and its sentences are the ones every app says. [`Mind`] is the same surface as a trait, so a
//! feature that asks the Mind is tested against [`fake::FakeMind`] with no shell.
