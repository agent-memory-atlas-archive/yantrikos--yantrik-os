//! Private mode, for an app's surface on this runtime (#924).
//!
//! The view itself is `yantrik_surface::private`'s, the same for a window and a service: in
//! Private mode `app.describe` answers with the app's id, `"private": true`, a neutral summary,
//! what is known of its windows, and only the keys of its own state it listed as not personal.
//! This module is the window side of it:
//!
//! - the socket door ([`super::ControlRpc`]) reads Private mode on its RPC thread for every call,
//!   where file IO belongs, and hands the answer to the UI thread with the call, so there is no
//!   cache to go stale and no restart: turning it on holds from the next call;
//! - a framework app's registry ([`wire`]) is told which keys the app shows (`Intents::
//!   shown_in_private`, default none), what its windows are (`open`, `windows_open`, from the
//!   core), and where an in-process read — a test's `describe` — learns Private mode.
//!
//! Under test (`cfg(test)` or the `testing` feature, which only a dev-dependency may turn on) a
//! test can also pin its own app private ([`testing::pin`]) without touching the file, or any
//! other test's app. A pin only adds: the app is private when pinned or when the file says so,
//! never less private than the person made it. The socket door never reads a pin: it reads the
//! file, under test as in a shipped build.
