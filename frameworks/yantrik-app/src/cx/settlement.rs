//! Settlements: the one answer an explicit intent is owed (design/app-framework-2026-10-21.md,
//! §3.1, settlement). Part of [`Core`]; here so the core's own file stays readable.
//!
//! An invocation opened with [`Core::open_settlement`] is answered exactly once: by `fx.settle`,
//! by its last job landing (the reply read after the result committed) with nothing of it still
//! queued, by that job panicking or being refused, by it being replaced, by a queued command of
//! it being refused, by the deadline (the waiter times out on its own), or by shutdown.
