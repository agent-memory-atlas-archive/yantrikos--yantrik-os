//! An exclusive lock on a file, held for as long as its guard lives and released by the kernel
//! when the process dies.
//!
//! This is what makes "one copy" atomic. A pid file alone is check-then-create: two launches in
//! the same instant both find no live pid, and the second unlinks the first's fresh file before
//! creating its own, so both run. `flock` has no gap. It is also released on any death, a crash
//! or a `kill -9` included, so a stale lock never keeps a person out of an app.
//!
//! The file is opened without following a link and created private (0600), because it sits in a
//! directory whose contents decide whether a process runs.
//!
//! On a local filesystem a second `hold` of the same file is refused even within one process. On
//! NFS (and CIFS with some mount options) Linux turns `flock` into a POSIX lock, which never
//! conflicts within a process and is released when any descriptor of the file is closed: there it
//! excludes other processes only, so a caller must not rely on an in-process refusal.
