# The other end is deploy/yantrik-os/server/yantrik-publish, installed as the forced command
# of the key this uses. This script streams the file and says what it is; the server hashes
# what arrived, refuses a mismatch, moves it into place, repoints `latest`, rewrites the
# manifest and prunes the channel to the newest three. None of that is done from here, on
# purpose: a client that prunes is a client that can delete, and the CI key cannot.

# The server's host key is pinned below rather than learned on first use. A pipeline that
# accepts whatever key answers will upload the release to whoever answers.
