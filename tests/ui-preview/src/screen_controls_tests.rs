//! Every screen the shell draws in a window frame can be left by its own controls (#231).
//!
//! On VM 520 the shell's editor screen filled the space between the bars with no minimise,
//! maximise or close in sight, so once it was open there was no way off it but the taskbar. The
//! frame hides its own title bar when a screen says it draws the controls itself, and the mind
//! panel's strip takes the right edge where controls sit. This presses along the header row of
//! each framed screen, maximised, from just left of the panel's strip leftwards, and requires a
//! press that takes the person off the screen — close, or minimise — before the middle of it.
