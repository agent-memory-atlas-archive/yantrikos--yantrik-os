"""The toolkit a conformance probe is written against.

`verify_calendar.py` and `verify_images.py` were the same script written twice: the same
`act` wrapper, the same pgrep, the same "put the machine back" tail, and the same bug in
each copy — a refusal was recorded as the string "1", because `yos` reports a refusal by
printing to stderr and exiting, and `str(SystemExit(1))` is "1". The refusal text is the
thing under test in contract point 4, so losing it loses the check.

This module is that script written once, with the refusal captured properly.

Three rules it enforces on every probe that uses it:

* **An assertion records, it does not raise.** One failed check must not hide the six
  after it. `Probe.check` appends a result and carries on; the probe exits nonzero at the
  end if anything required failed.
* **Restoration always runs.** `preserved` and `moved_aside` are context managers that
  restore on the way out of the block, on an exception, on SIGTERM, and via `atexit` if
  something more violent happens. The VM is a shared machine with the user's own windows
  on it.
* **Evidence is what something else says.** The helpers read processes, the compositor,
  and files on disk. An action's own answer is evidence of what the action claimed, and
  is recorded as such — never as proof that it happened.
