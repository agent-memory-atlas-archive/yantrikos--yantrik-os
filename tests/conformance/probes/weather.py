"""Weather's one job: remember the places someone saved, and say when it cannot find one.

Two faults are under test here.

`WeatherState::save()` was defined and never called, while `new()` read the file back — so the
round trip looked whole and every saved city and the choice of degrees vanished at the next
launch. Nothing short of killing the app and reopening it proves that is fixed, and the file on
disk is checked as well as what the window says, because the window could be holding the right
value for the wrong reason.

`add_location` answered `{"added": name, "saved": N}` whether or not the geocoder found anything.
So a name that cannot resolve must come back as a refusal — and as a refusal a caller can read.
This machine may have no internet, which is why nothing here requires a *successful* lookup: a
lookup that fails has to say so, and that is the assertion either way.

This probe was written before `lib.py` and carried its own `act()` with the bug `lib` exists to
fix: `yos` reports a refusal by printing to stderr and exiting, so `str(SystemExit(1))` is the
string "1", and every refusal in this report read "1" — including the one this file's whole third
section is about. It is ported now, and the refusal is asserted on as text: the app's own words,
naming the place it could not find, and told to the person in `describe.notice` as well. Whether
the refusal came from the app or from the machine's ceiling is read off the answer with
`lib.refusal_kind` rather than guessed at from the sentence; a ceiling refusal would satisfy "it
did not answer success" while proving nothing about the app, so where one happens the checks about
the app's own words are recorded as NOT EXERCISED instead of passed.
