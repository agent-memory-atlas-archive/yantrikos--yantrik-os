"""yDoc's one job: write a document and keep it.

Until today this app could not keep anything. `on_doc_save` read `doc-file-path`, an `in`
property that nothing in the process ever wrote, found it empty, logged "No file path set" and
returned; the `std::fs::write` beneath the guard had never executed once. There was no command
line and `on_doc_open` was a log line, so no path could reach the app by any route. What made it
urgent is what did work: the AI path really asks the companion and really replaces the whole
document, so the app could take your writing away and give you something else, and you could not
save the result.

So the check at the centre of this probe is the one that was impossible before: `set_content`,
then `save_as`, then read the bytes off the disk and compare them to the text that was sent. The
witness is always the file — its bytes, its size, its content after a kill — and never the
action's own answer. `describe` is checked against the file, not the other way round.

The app publishes as `documents`, which is the id the launcher routes (`dock.rs`:
`Launch::Program { id: "documents", bin: "yantrik-document-editor" }`) and the id the window sets
on `AppIdentity`. This file is named after the app so the report reads `document-editor`; the two
names are the same app and the constants below keep them apart.
