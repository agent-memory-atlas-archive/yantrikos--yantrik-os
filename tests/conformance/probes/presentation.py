"""yPresent's one job: keep a deck of slides and show them in order.

The fault this is mostly about is one no screenshot could have found. `on_next_slide` and
`on_prev_slide` moved `current-slide-index` and did nothing else — no commit of what was on the
canvas, no reload of the slide moved to — so the canvas went on holding the text of the slide
you had just been typing into, and the next thing that committed it wrote that text into the
slide you had moved to. Typing, pressing Next, and clicking a thumbnail destroyed a slide. The
window looked correct at every step, and the six handlers that were written correctly are what
did the overwriting.

So the middle of this probe is that sequence, driven over the surface: two slides with distinct
text, `next`, `go_to`, and then a reading of what the second slide actually says. It fails on
the old code and passes on the new one.

The rest is the contract. Save and Load were log lines, so a deck existed only while the window
was open: the deck is written to a path this probe chose, checked as a file this probe parses
itself, and then the app is killed and started again with that path on its command line —
contract points 2, 5 and 6 in one move, verified against the bytes on disk and never against the
action's own answer.

`delete_slide` is graded `sensitive` because its whole effect is that a slide someone wrote is
gone. The machine's ceiling is the user's setting; when it stands in front of this action the
app's delete code did not run and was not measured, and the checks that were about the app are
recorded as NOT EXERCISED rather than passed on the ceiling's sentence. This probe does not
raise the ceiling: a green run bought that way would be worth less than an honest omission.

Nothing is left behind. The deck goes in a temp directory of this probe's own, and
`~/Documents/Presentations` and the recovery file under `~/.local/state/yantrik/presentation`
are both snapshotted on the way in and restored on the way out — those are the two places the
app writes to when nobody has named a path.
