//! Themes on the shell's control surface: what `describe shell` says under `theme`, the
//! `set_theme` action that Settings' theme cards also reach (`wire::theme::choose`), and
//! `set_dark_style`, the Quick Settings tile's and Settings' Dark/Light choice.
//!
//! `sensitive`: a theme changes how the whole desktop looks and rewrites files outside the shell
//! (labwc's theme, the terminal's colours, GTK's scheme). The person can put it back with a click,
//! but a mind that repaints their desktop unasked is exactly the kind of thing their grade is
//! for.
//!
//! The answer is a reading, not the request: the theme the shell now has, from the same property
//! the Settings card reads. The files on the machine are written on a worker after the answer
//! (labwc is asked to reload there, with a timeout), and the answer says so.
//!
//! `set_dark_style` is `standard`: it flips the appearance the tile flips, through the same
//! callback (`toggle-dark-mode`, wired in `wire::settings`), which saves `dark_mode`. It touches
//! no file outside the shell and one click puts it back. `describe shell` reports the mode under
//! `settings.dark`. Named for the tile ("Dark style"), not `set_dark_mode`: an action whose name
//! says "mode" reads as a change to what a mind may do, and control_approvals' guard holds that
//! name for `set_mind_mode` alone.
