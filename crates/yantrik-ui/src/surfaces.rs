//! Surfaces a mind can find while they are closed — read from the apps' own `.desktop` files.
//!
//! A running surface is found by its socket. A closed one used to be known only through tables
//! written into this shell: the launch routes, the purposes, the apps' alias table. So an app
//! somebody else wrote could not be listed while closed, could not declare another name, could not
//! be opened by `open_app` under its surface id, and a button on its notification reached nothing.
//! Our own apps could do all of that only because their names were typed into the shell.
//!
//! Now every app declares itself where every Debian app already describes itself — its `.desktop`
//! file — with four keys (`yantrik_shell_core::apps`, design/surface-sdk-2026-09-23.md §4):
//!
//! ```text
//! X-Yantrik-Surface=libreoffice
//! X-Yantrik-Purpose=Documents, spreadsheets and slides: open, read, edit and export them
//! X-Yantrik-Aliases=writer;calc;impress
//! X-Yantrik-Adapter=/usr/lib/yantrik/adapters/libreoffice
//! ```
//!
//! and this module is what the shell does with them:
//!
//! - [`declared`] is the catalogue of surfaces, one per id, with the names each may use: a name
//!   the desktop itself answers to (`shell`, a screen, a settings section) or that another surface
//!   already holds is not handed out twice.
//! - [`find`] resolves any name a caller holds — the id, an alias, the app's Name, its entry id —
//!   to the surface and the entry that launches it. `wire::dock` asks it for `open_app`,
//!   notification buttons and approvals.
//! - [`link_aliases_in`] links every alias at its surface's socket (`app-<alias>.sock` →
//!   `app-<id>.sock`), so `yos describe <alias>` works for an app that never heard of aliases —
//!   a Python surface, Blender's addon, anything.
//! - [`watch`] rescans when an application directory changes and relinks.
//! - [`start_adapter`] / [`app_exited`] run an `X-Yantrik-Adapter` beside the app it serves.
//!
//! This OS's own apps ship `.desktop` files with the same keys and get exactly this, nothing more.
