//! Drawing toasts. Not deciding what a toast is.
//!
//! ## What this used to be
//!
//! `push_toast` was the shell's whole notification system: it appended to a Slint model AND
//! wrote into the shell's own private JSON store, from six call sites — screenshots, focus mode,
//! the companion bridge, the D-Bus relay, the Do Not Disturb hotkey. Nothing it recorded ever
//! reached the notifications service, so the notification screen could not show a screenshot
//! toast, an app could not raise one, and a mind could not read one. It also gave each toast an
//! id made from the wall clock in milliseconds, so two toasts raised in the same millisecond
//! shared an id and dismissing one dismissed both.
//!
//! ## What it is now
//!
//! The rendering half only. [`wire::notifications`](super::notifications) polls the one store
//! and calls [`push`] for each new notification; this file owns the queue, the three-at-a-time
//! rule, the "+N more" count and the sweep that takes an expired toast off the screen. Ids are
//! the store's.
//!
//! One exception is [`local`], for a toast that must **not** be stored — see its comment.
//!
//! ## No timer per toast
//!
//! Each toast used to start its own `slint::Timer` and then `std::mem::forget` it, so a machine
//! left running leaked one timer per notification, forever. There is one repeating sweeper
//! instead: it runs while any toast is up, expires whatever is due, and stops itself when the
//! queue empties. A timer cannot be dropped from inside its own callback, which is the reason
//! the per-toast version reached for `forget` in the first place.
