//! The unlock prompt: the one way a vault passphrase enters this machine.
//!
//! Three jobs, all of them small.
//!
//! **Seed the cache.** `describe shell` answers on the UI thread and the database lives on the
//! companion's worker, so the vault's state is read once at startup and kept in
//! `vault_unlock`'s statics from there. Without it the first `describe` after boot would have to
//! choose between blocking on a worker that might be mid-thought and guessing.
//!
//! **Notice when a mind wanted the vault and could not have it.** The tools set a latch
//! (`yantrik_companion::tools::vault::take_unlock_request`) rather than calling into the shell,
//! because they are a leaf crate the shell depends on and the call would be a cycle. This polls
//! it.
//!
//! **Take the keystrokes.** `on_vault_unlock_submit` is wired here and nowhere else. It is a
//! Slint callback, which means the only thing that can fire it is a person pressing Enter or
//! clicking a button in a window this shell drew — the same property the approval card's
//! `on_approval_allow` has, and for the same reason.
