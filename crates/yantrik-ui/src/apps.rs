//! App registry — re-exports from yantrik-shell-core, plus the live catalogue.
//!
//! All app registry logic (DesktopEntry, builtin_apps, scan, search) lives in
//! yantrik-shell-core. This module re-exports it, and adds the one thing the shell needs that
//! a pure scan cannot give it: a catalogue that can change while the shell is running.

///
/// This used to be `Arc<Vec<DesktopEntry>>` on AppContext, scanned once during startup and
/// cloned into every closure that needed it. That is a snapshot, and it has one consequence
/// nobody had written down: install something and it does not exist. Not "appears late" —
/// it is absent from the launcher, from the Lens, and from `open_app`, until the shell is
/// restarted. On a desktop whose whole premise is that you can ask it for things, an app you
/// just installed being unaskable is a strange thing to ship.
///
/// So the catalogue is shared and swappable. Readers take a cheap snapshot for the duration of
/// one call and never hold the lock; `refresh` rescans and replaces it in one move, so a reader
/// either sees the whole old list or the whole new one.
