//! Reach a service that is only started when something needs it.
//!
//! The machine rail calls calendar, email and notes "on demand", and until recently that was a
//! label on a stopped process rather than a mechanism: nothing started them, so every call an app
//! made to one failed at connect. The calendar could not save an appointment on a freshly booted
//! machine, and said it had.
//!
//! The shell owns service lifetimes through its ServiceManager, so this asks the shell to start
//! one rather than spawning a binary behind its back — otherwise the rail would report "on
//! demand" for a process that is running, which is the same class of lie in the other direction.
//!
//! This lived in `yantrik-app-runtime` while only apps needed it. `yantrik-app-runtime` pulls in
//! Slint, and the built-in companion — which now reaches the calendar the same way an app does —
//! must not carry a toolkit to make a socket call. The logic needs nothing from this crate but
//! [`SyncRpcClient`] and [`RpcServer::default_address`], so it lives here and
//! `yantrik_app_runtime::service` re-exports it unchanged.
//!
//! ## Two ways to start a service, and when each is right
//!
//! An app is a separate process. It has no ServiceManager and cannot have one, so it asks the
//! shell over the shell's own control surface: `app.act start_service`. That is the default
//! below, and it is the path every app under `apps/` takes.
//!
//! The companion is not a separate process. It runs on a worker thread *inside* the shell, a few
//! frames away from the ServiceManager itself. For it, the socket round trip would leave the
//! process only to come back in, and `app.act` is dispatched onto the Slint event loop, so the
//! start would queue behind whatever the compositor thread is doing and is given three seconds
//! there before the caller is told the app did not answer. Neither hop buys anything: the manager
//! is right there, it is `Send + Sync`, and starting a service is a mutex and a `spawn`.
//!
//! So a process that owns the manager installs it here with [`set_local_starter`], and [`ensure`]
//! uses it in place of the round trip. The shell does this in `main` once the manager exists.
//! Nothing else changes: the same function starts the same service through the same manager, and
//! the rail still reads the one list.
