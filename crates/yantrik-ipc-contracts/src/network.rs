//! Network service contract — interfaces, connectivity, resolvers, Wi-Fi, firewall.
//!
//! # What these types exist to prevent
//!
//! Calendar's two ends drifted over parameter *names* while each file looked right on its own
//! page. Network's two ends never agreed on a method name at all. `apps/network-manager` called
//! `network.wifi_toggle`, `network.wifi_scan`, `network.wifi_connect`, `network.wifi_disconnect`
//! and `network.wifi_forget`; `services/network-service` implemented `network.interfaces`,
//! `network.status` and `network.dns` and answered everything else with "Unknown method". Not one
//! name in common. Three of the five calls were made into a `let _ =`, so the button logged that
//! it had toggled the radio and returned, and the app looked like it worked.
//!
//! The method names are constants here now, and every request and every response is a struct both
//! ends build and parse. A rename cannot land on one end alone: it stops compiling on the other.
//!
//! The response types moved here for the same reason. They lived in the service as "not in
//! contracts yet" and the app re-read them field by field out of a `serde_json::Value`, with
//! `serde_json::from_value(v).unwrap_or_default()` over the interface list — so a shape change on
//! the service side emptied the ethernet list in the window and said nothing. There is no
//! hand-written key left on either side of this wire.
