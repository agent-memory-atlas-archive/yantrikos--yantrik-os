//! Weather Watch instinct — proactive alerts for notable weather conditions.
//!
//! Unlike generic "it's sunny today" small talk, this instinct only fires when
//! weather is actionable: storms, extreme temperatures, rain expected, etc.
//! Fetches weather once per check interval (default 2 hours) and analyzes
//! conditions against alert thresholds.
//!
//! # The alert that fired on a clear day
//!
//! It did not do any of that. It asked wttr.in for `%C %t humidity:%h wind:%w` and then tested
//! the WHOLE reply against a keyword list containing "wind" — so the word it had just asked the
//! server to print back was the word it treated as evidence of a storm. Every check matched.
//! On a machine reporting `Clear +87°F humidity:45% wind:↑9mph` the desktop said
//! "Notable weather: Clear +87°F humidity:45% wind:↑9mph", which is not notable and is not
//! even a sentence — it is the query echoed back with an adjective in front of it.
//!
//! A proactive surface that interrupts on nothing teaches people to ignore it, and this was the
//! ONLY producer feeding the desktop's card region, so it was most of what that surface ever
//! said. Two changes: the reply is parsed into fields before anything is matched, so a label can
//! never be mistaken for a condition, and wind has to actually be strong.
