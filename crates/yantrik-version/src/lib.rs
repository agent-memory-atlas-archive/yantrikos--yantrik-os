//! One version, for every surface that has to say what is running here.
//!
//! ── What this replaces ──
//!
//! A machine was asked three times what it was and gave three answers:
//!
//! ```text
//! /opt/yantrik/.version   0.3.0
//! /opt/yantrik/BUILD      version=v0.1.0-179-g6fc8b13
//! the terminal banner     Yantrik Terminal v0.1.0
//! ```
//!
//! None of the three was lying on purpose. `.version` was written once, by the ISO that
//! installed the machine, back when that script had `0.3.0` typed into it, and nothing has
//! rewritten it since — not the installer, not `yantrik-update`. `BUILD` is written from
//! `git describe` by whatever produced the build, and was the only one of the three that
//! was current. The banner, and the About screen, and the Settings screen, each showed the
//! `version` field of a `Cargo.toml` — `0.3.0` for the shell, `0.1.0` for the apps — numbers
//! nobody has moved in months and which say nothing about which build is installed.
//!
//! The answer to "which of them is right" cannot be a convention people remember. So there is
//! one function, and every surface calls it.
//!
//! ── Where the answer comes from ──
//!
//! In order, first non-empty wins:
//!
//! 1. `$YANTRIK_VERSION` — a caller that already knows (a test, a launcher, a one-off run of a
//!    binary out of a build directory against an installed tree).
//! 2. `version=` in the installed BUILD marker, `$YANTRIK_PREFIX/BUILD`, default
//!    `/opt/yantrik/BUILD`. This is the machine's own record of what was installed: written by
//!    `build-release.sh` into the bundle, copied in by the ISO build, and rewritten by
//!    `yantrik-update` on every apply and rollback. It is also the field `yantrik-update`
//!    compares to decide whether an update exists, so agreeing with it is the point.
//! 3. `YANTRIK_BUILD_VERSION`, baked by this crate's `build.rs` from the same
//!    `git describe --tags --always --dirty` the release scripts run. This is the answer during
//!    development, where there is no installed tree to read.
//! 4. This crate's own package version, as a last resort.
//!
//! The marker comes before the baked string on purpose. A binary can outlive the tree it was
//! built in — `deploy-to-vm.sh` copies binaries onto a machine, `yantrik-update` swaps them —
//! and the question every one of these surfaces is really answering is "what is installed on
//! this machine", which is what the marker records.
//!
//! Step 4 is a single constant rather than each crate's own `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` because
//! per-crate versions are what produced the disagreement above: the shell says `0.3.0`, the
//! apps say `0.1.0`, and neither tracks anything.
