//! The proxy: one connection, from its head to the tunnel.
//!
//! In order, each step able to end it with a sentence:
//!
//! 1. the caller's account, read from the kernel, must be the mind's;
//! 2. the head, read whole (bounded in size and time), must be a request this proxy serves;
//! 3. what can be decided without a lookup is (Private mode; in enforce, whether any rule covers
//!    the name; on the public door, whether a `lan` rule names it — `crate::door`) — a lookup is
//!    a message to whoever serves the name, so nothing is resolved that may not be reached;
//! 4. the name is resolved here, the mind resolves nothing itself, and every address it gave is
//!    classed: this machine's own, loopback and the like go nowhere; an address on a prefix this
//!    machine is on, or one of its routers, is the local network whatever its range
//!    (`crate::local::place`);
//! 5. the door's verdict (the public door: the internet only), then the policy's, counted
//!    either way;
//! 6. the connection, then bytes both ways until either end closes or both are quiet for
//!    [`IDLE`]. A plain-HTTP request forwards exactly the body its head declared, and no second
//!    request after it.
