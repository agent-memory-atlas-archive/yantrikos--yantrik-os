//! The one calendar, as the mind's tools see it.
//!
//! There were two. The Calendar app and the control surface used `calendar-service`, one JSON
//! file per event under `~/.local/share/yantrik/calendar/`; the companion's own calendar tools
//! kept a SQLite table of their own. Neither read the other, so "put it on my calendar", asked of
//! the companion, landed somewhere the Calendar app would never show, and an appointment made in
//! the app was invisible to the mind. `design/calendar-2026-09-20.md` found it and did not fix it.
//!
//! One owner per domain: `calendar-service` owns calendar data, and everything here is a caller.
//! The trait exists so the tools can be tested without a socket — the fake in the tests answers
//! the same six questions the service does — and so a tool's failure path is exercised rather
//! than assumed. It is deliberately the service's own shape: the typed parameters out of
//! `yantrik_ipc_contracts::calendar`, never hand-written JSON keys. Hand-written keys are what
//! left the app asking for `start` where the service required `start_date`, and that bug was
//! invisible from either file on its own.
