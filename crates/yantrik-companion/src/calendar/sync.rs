//! Google Calendar, pulled into the machine's own calendar rather than beside it.
//!
//! The old shape was local-first into SQLite: a Google event was cached in the companion's
//! database and a local event was written there too, so the Calendar app showed neither. The sync
//! now writes through `calendar-service`, keyed on the event's id at Google, which does two
//! things at once — a synced event appears in the Calendar app like any other, and syncing the
//! same week twice edits the same file instead of storing a second copy of everything.
//!
//! With no OAuth2 account configured this is a quiet no-op, as it was before. The calendar works
//! without Google and always did; that is not the part that was broken.
//!
//! ## What this does not do
//!
//! **Events deleted at Google are not removed here.** The old code deleted a date range from its
//! cache before re-inserting, which made a remote deletion disappear and took every local event
//! in the range with it — that range delete is one of the reasons an appointment made through the
//! mind could vanish. Doing it properly needs Google's own sync tokens, so that "not in this
//! answer" can be told apart from "not in this page of this answer", and that is not built. A
//! meeting cancelled in Google's web UI stays on this machine's calendar until it is deleted here.
//!
//! **One page, one window.** `list_events` asks for at most `max_results` and does not follow
//! `nextPageToken`, which is how it has always been. A very busy week can come back short.
