//! Vault tools — secure credential storage with AES-256-GCM encryption.
//!
//! Tools: vault_store, vault_get, vault_list, vault_delete, vault_generate_password, vault_set_pin
//!
//! # A mind does not carry the passphrase
//!
//! Every one of these tools used to take a `pin` argument, with a description telling the model to
//! "ask the user for it". That was written when the PIN was a hash in a table that gated the tools
//! while the key sat beside it in the clear — so the PIN was a formality and relaying it cost
//! nothing that was not already lost.
//!
//! It is not a formality now. The PIN *is* the passphrase the vault's key is wrapped under, and a
//! model that asks for it puts it in a conversation: in the transcript, in the context window, on
//! the wire to whatever provider is answering, and in whatever that provider keeps. A companion
//! running over Telegram would have carried it across a third party's servers to unlock a vault on
//! a desk. Asking the person is right; asking them *through the model* is not.
//!
//! So the argument is gone, and with it the whole class of bug where a caller supplies the secret.
//! A locked vault answers [`LOCKED_ANSWER`] and [`request_unlock`] puts a prompt on the desktop,
//! which the person types into and the model never sees. What the model can do about a locked
//! vault is tell the person the desktop is asking — which is the true and only answer.
//!
//! Security model:
//!   - All credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM at rest (vault-specific DEK)
//!   - The DEK is wrapped under a passphrase with Argon2id when the vault is protected; a vault
//!     that has never been protected keeps it in the file, and `vault_list` says so out loud
//!   - A protected vault that has not been unlocked in this process returns nothing at all
