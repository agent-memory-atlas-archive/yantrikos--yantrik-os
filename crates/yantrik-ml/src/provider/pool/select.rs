//! Which free model takes a request.
//!
//! 1. Only providers the person switched on, with a key when one is needed.
//! 2. Only models that can do the job: tools, JSON, enough context, good enough at code.
//! 3. Never a provider that may train on prompts for a private turn; never one whose terms do not
//!    allow it for an answer the public will see.
//! 4. A task keeps the model it started on while that model has room (`sticky`): an agent loop
//!    that changes model every step gets worse answers and wastes the providers' caches.
//! 5. Otherwise the model with the most room left, weighted toward stronger coders when the
//!    work is code; ties are taken in turn, so equal providers share the load.
