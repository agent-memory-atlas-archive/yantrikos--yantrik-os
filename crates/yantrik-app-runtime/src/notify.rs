//! Tell the person something, in one line, from anywhere.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Until now an app had no way to raise a notification at all. A download finished, an event was
//! about to start, an update was waiting — and none of it left the app's own window. The shell
//! had a private toast queue, but the shell is not a library and an app is a separate process;
//! the notifications service existed and **nothing in the tree ever called it**.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use yantrik_app_runtime::notify::{self, Notification};
//!
//! notify::send(
//!     Notification::new("Downloads", "debian-13.iso finished")
//!         .body("Saved to ~/Downloads")
//!         .action("open_folder", "Open folder"),
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! ## What it promises
//!
//! **It never blocks the caller.** Every call hands the work to a short-lived thread and returns.
//! An app's UI thread has a three-second budget for a whole control-surface round trip; a
//! notification must not spend any of it. There is a test that calls `send` with no service
//! running and asserts the call returned in milliseconds.
//!
//! **It starts the service.** The notifications service is autostarted by the shell, but a
//! machine where it died, or an app launched before the shell finished, would otherwise silently
//! drop the message. `service::ensure` is the same on-demand start the calendar and email use.
//!
//! **It is bounded, and it says so once.** If the service cannot be reached the message is lost —
//! there is nowhere else to put it — and that is logged the first time and not again, because a
//! failing service plus a chatty retry is how a log stops being readable. At most
//! [`MAX_IN_FLIGHT`] sends are in the air at once; past that a send is dropped rather than
//! spawning threads without limit, since anything on this machine can call this.
//!
//! **It does not carry its own store.** Everything goes to the one service, so a notification
//! raised by an app is the same object the shell draws, the notification centre lists, and a
//! mind reads in `describe`.
