//! The ring, and the wait.
//!
//! Sources push observations from their own threads; readers ask for everything after the last
//! sequence number they saw. Two decisions are load-bearing:
//!
//! **Bounded, and honest about it.** The ring holds a fixed number of observations and overwrites
//! the oldest. A perception system must not be able to exhaust memory because something started
//! writing files in a loop. A reader that falls behind is told how many it missed rather than
//! being handed a silently shortened list — a gap you can see is a different thing from a gap you
//! cannot.
//!
//! **A wait, not a poll.** The whole argument for watching from the kernel is that it costs
//! nothing while nothing is happening. Answering `perception.since` by returning immediately would
//! push the polling one layer up and give all of it back, so a reader with nothing to read parks
//! on a condvar until either something arrives or its patience runs out.
