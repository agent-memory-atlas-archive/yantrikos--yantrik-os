//! What was written, and by whom.
//!
//! `crates/yantrik-os/src/files.rs` already watches directories with inotify, and inotify has one
//! shape of blindness that cannot be worked around: it reports that a file changed and never who
//! changed it. "Something wrote `report.odt`" is a fact with nowhere to go. "LibreOffice saved
//! `report.odt`" is a thing a person would say.
//!
//! fanotify hands over the acting pid with every event, which is the whole reason to prefer it and
//! most of the reason this service is privileged.
//!
//! # Why there are two groups
//!
//! The first version of this file watched `FAN_CLOSE_WRITE` and called it a save. That is wrong,
//! and wrong in the case that matters most. `FAN_CLOSE_WRITE` means *a writable descriptor was
//! closed* — nothing more. Every serious editor saves by writing a scratch file and renaming it
//! over the document, because a rename is atomic and a partial write is a lost afternoon. So vim
//! saving `report.odt` closes `.report.odt.swpx`, and the rename that actually replaces the
//! document is a directory-entry change that group never sees.
//!
//! It is worse than reporting the wrong name, because it is not even reliably wrong. fanotify
//! hands over a *descriptor*, and the path comes from reading `/proc/self/fd/N` afterwards — which
//! resolves to whatever that inode is called at the moment we look. Drain the queue before the
//! editor's rename lands and we report `.report.odt.swpx`; drain it after and we report
//! `report.odt`, correctly and entirely by luck. Which one happens is a race with another process.
//! Measured here the rename usually won — which is precisely how a bug like this survives a probe,
//! especially one that only tested `echo probe > note.txt`, the single shape of save that writes
//! in place and is not representative of anything.
//!
//! With both groups the outcome stops depending on the race. Lose it, and the descriptor group
//! reports the scratch file — a [`Kind::Wrote`] — while the rename supplies the save. Win it, and
//! the descriptor group already names the document, so the rename is the same save described
//! twice, which the bus coalesces. Either way: exactly one save, correctly named and attributed.
//!
//! Directory-entry events (`FAN_MOVED_TO` and friends) are not deliverable as descriptors — the
//! event is about a *name in a directory*, not about an open file — so the kernel requires a group
//! initialised with `FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME`, which reports a file handle for the parent directory
//! plus the entry name. That is a different event layout and cannot share a group with the
//! descriptor-carrying one. Hence two:
//!
//! | group | mask | tells us |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | descriptor | `FAN_CLOSE_WRITE`, `FAN_OPEN_EXEC` | a file was written or run, with a path |
//! | dirent | `FAN_MOVED_TO` | a name in a watched directory now points at something else |
//!
//! # Raw facts and inferred ones are kept apart
//!
//! [`Kind::Wrote`] is what the kernel said. [`Kind::Saved`] is what we think it meant, and carries
//! [`SaveShape`] so a reader can see which observation established it. Nothing is dropped to make
//! the inference tidy: a scratch-file close is still recorded, it simply does not claim to be a
//! save.
//!
//! # Resolving a directory handle without privilege
//!
//! `open_by_handle_at` would turn the kernel's handle back into a path, and needs
//! `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` — which this service gives away deliberately and permanently at startup.
//! So the map is built the other way round and in advance: while still privileged, every directory
//! we mark is put through `name_to_handle_at`, and the resulting handle is remembered against its
//! path. At event time the lookup is a hash of bytes the kernel handed us. Same shape as the
//! descriptors themselves — do the privileged part first, keep only the result.
//!
//! # Two choices worth defending
//!
//! **A close, not a modify.** `FAN_MODIFY` would fire on every write and drown everything else in
//! the ring.
//!
//! **Directory marks, not a filesystem mark.** `FAN_MARK_FILESYSTEM` would catch everything
//! including subdirectories created later, at the cost of being told about every write on the
//! disk and filtering afterwards — the daemon would *receive* events about `~/.ssh` and choose
//! not to report them. Marking only the directories in scope means those events are never
//! delivered at all. The scope becomes structural rather than a promise, which is the same reason
//! Landlock is here.
//!
//! The cost is real and stated plainly: a directory created after start is not watched until the
//! service restarts.
