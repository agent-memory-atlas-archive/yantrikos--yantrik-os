//! `nmcli`, and what its answers mean.
//!
//! Split out of `main.rs` so the part that decides what a command's output *means* can be tested
//! on a machine with no NetworkManager on it, and on a machine with no Wi-Fi adapter in it — see
//! `tests/network-core`. Nothing below the [`run`] function starts a process; the parsers and the
//! classifier are pure functions over captured text.
//!
//! # Why nmcli
//!
//! `deploy/yantrik-os/build-debian-iso.sh` installs `network-manager` and enables the
//! `NetworkManager` unit; `deploy/yantrik-os/cloud-init/user-data.yaml` installs the same package
//! with a note saying it was added because nmcli is called from nine places in this codebase and
//! was absent from every machine. So NetworkManager is what this OS ships and nmcli is its
//! command line. `wpasupplicant` is installed too, but as NetworkManager's WPA backend rather
//! than as something to drive directly; there is no `iwd` and no `iwctl` anywhere in the build.
//!
//! # The terse format
//!
//! Everything here reads `nmcli -t`, which prints one record per line with `:` between fields.
//! A `:` inside a value is escaped `\:` and a backslash is escaped `\\`, and an SSID may contain
//! either — `Cafe: Free` and `C:\\Wifi` are both legal network names. Splitting on a bare `:`
//! silently truncates those, which is how an SSID becomes unjoinable without anything looking
//! wrong. [`split_terse`] is the one place that is handled.
